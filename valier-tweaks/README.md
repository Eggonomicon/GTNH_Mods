# Valier Tweaks

Server-side. Clients need nothing. Small gameplay fixes for the Valier server.

## Lumber axes fell the whole tree

A Tinkers' Construct **lumber axe** fells a tree one log at a time and stops the moment the axe breaks, or the player
switches items. The rest of the tree is left floating. Tinkers has no setting for this.

With this mod, once a lumber axe chop stops early, the rest of the tree comes down too:

- **Same tree shape:** it walks the tree the way Tinkers does (each log, then the 3x3 around it on its own layer and
  the one above), starting from the logs Tinkers already broke.
- **Like breaking by hand:** the extra logs drop normally and the axe takes no more wear (it's broken, or not in
  hand).
- **Protection respected:** each extra log fires the normal block-break event, so claims and other protection mods
  still apply. A log they protect stays, and the rest of the tree still comes down.
- **Only real tree chops:** only chops Tinkers itself treated as a tree are finished (enough leaves at the top, player
  not sneaking). Breaking a single log, or a log wall without leaves, works as before.
- **A cap:** at most `maxExtraLogs` (1024) extra logs per tree. A lumber axe also fells logs that touch the tree, such as
  a log wall built against it.

The server log says when it finishes a tree: `Finished a tree for <player> at x y z: N more log(s), after the lumber
axe broke`.

Tinkers' Construct is optional: without it, the mod does nothing. It finds Tinkers' classes by name and has no hard
dependency.

## Config (`config/valiertweaks.cfg`)

| Setting | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `finishLumberAxeTrees` | `true` | Fell the rest of a tree when a lumber axe chop stops early. |
| `maxExtraLogs` | `1024` | At most this many extra logs per tree. |
| `logsPerTick` | `128` | Extra logs broken per tick (Tinkers' own rate). |

## Build and test

- **Build:** `gradlew --offline assemble` (JDK 25). The self-test compiles against a GTNH 2.9 server's Tinkers'
  Construct jar (see `dependencies.gradle`). Point it at your server folder with `-PgtnhInstance=<folder>`; by default
  it is `../../GTNH_Instance`.
- **Self-test:** on a test server started with `-Dvaliertweaks.selftest=true`, run `valiertweaks selftest trees`. It
  builds four trees and a log wall, and fake players chop them with real Tinkers lumber axes:
  - A, with an axe that has 3 uses left: the whole tree falls, every log drops, and the axe broke.
  - B, with a fresh axe: Tinkers fells it all, and this mod does nothing.
  - C, a log wall without leaves: no more than Tinkers' own 3x3 goes.
  - D, a sneaking player: only the clicked log goes.
  - E, with one log protected by a cancelled break event: everything but that log falls.

  The results are checked 3 seconds later, and the area is cleared afterwards.
